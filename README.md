Ramble is a JAMstack IndieWeb publishing platform. It's intended to be a boilerplate you can get started using immediately and use as a launchpad to customize to fit your needs. It will be built on React and Next.js, Prisma, and Tailwind.

This project is still very much in development! We'll update the README when we have a version ready for production use.
